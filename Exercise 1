Starting with the rightmost node:
Arc:    Weight:
AB        10
AC        10
CE        11
EF        5
FD        7
EH        8
HK        7
KI        12
IJ        6
JG        10
The result is exactly the same minimum spanning tree.
This is not to say that there cannot be multiple minimum spanning trees for a graph though.
